 .. _backwards-incompatible-changes-0.18.0:

Backwards-incompatible changes in RapidSMS 0.18.0
=================================================

* Since Django 1.7 has it's own migration framework, South is now deprecated. If
  you are still using Django < 1.7, you will need to upgrade South to version >
  1.0, otherwise it will get confused by migration files which are meant for
  Django 1.7, not for South. (The ``migrations`` directories now contain Django
  1.7 migrations. South migrations have been moved to a ``south_migrations``
  directory, but older versions of South will not look in that directory.)
